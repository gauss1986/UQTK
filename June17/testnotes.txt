1. The efactor, which is the realtive level of randomness in epsilon has surprising low impact on the performance of all algorithms. 

2. The mckfactor has some impact on the performance of algorithms.

3. The p value, which is the threshold of AAPG adaptive algo, has impact on the cost and error of AAPG2. Worth mention in the thesis.
