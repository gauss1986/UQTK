# UQTK

C++ code for Lin Gao's research on the anchored functional analysis of variance (AAPG) scheme for intrusive uncertainty quantification. 

The code depends on the [UQTK package](http://www.sandia.gov/UQToolkit/) from Sandia National Lab. It demonstrates the AAPG scheme in  a Duffing oscillator system (nonlinear ODE). Main functions are Duffing.cpp (single-dof) and nDuffing.cpp (multi-dof). Currently built on IBM P7 in [Scinet](https://www.scinethpc.ca/) using GNU compiler with openMP.
